SideHustle app
This is the web app for SideHustle which is a personal project made by Prama Yudhistira aimed in helping students make money around campus by posting their side hustles online. Many college students don't have a car so if they want to make quick cash they can post whatever they want on this app where some other college student in the same campus may need their services

Unique value proposition: it is similar to craigslist but for college students

Tech stack: I am currently building the backend code using ASP.NET and planning on using Angular for the UI. However, I plan on creating a mobile version of this using React

Running on dotnet version 7.0.305

Entity Framework version 7.0.3

NOTE:- KEY value types will be changed to Guids, make sure to treat ids as strings
- may have to change IDs to Guids so treat everything as a string
